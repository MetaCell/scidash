INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Edit the haproxy.cfg, in the section pasted below:

backend www-backend
    # Tell haproxy to redirect all http traffic to https
    redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc }
    server www-1 172.20.0.4:8000 check

Change the ip address in the last line to match the one used by docker container that runs Scidash.
Rebuild the haproxy docker image.

=======================================

2. Run the image as per below

docker run --net=host -it haproxy:latest

(if the image has been built as haproxy:latest, differently change that part to point to the relevant image just built).
